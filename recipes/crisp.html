    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Much easier to make than a pie, this baked dessert pairs apples and cinnamon with a crispy oat topping.</p>
    <p>A crisp is much simpler to make than a pie; all you need to do is scatter the topping over the fruit in the baking dish. But there's a secret to making a much-better-than-average crunchy, chunky topping: working the oat mixture into large clumps with your hands. This helps the topping hold together atop the apples while baking to a golden brown.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, (spooned and leveled)</li>
        <li>¼ cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar/li>
        <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (not quick-cooking)</li>
        <li>3 pounds apples, such as Empire, Gala, or Braeburn, peeled, cored, and cut into ½-inch chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl, mix together flour, brown sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons granulated sugar. Cut butter into flour, using a pastry blender or two knives, until mixture is the texture of coarse meal.</li>
            <li>Add oats, and use your hands to toss and squeeze mixture until large, moist clumps form. Transfer to freezer to chill while you prepare apples.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice, cinnamon, and remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a shallow 2-quart baking dish, and sprinkle with topping mixture. Place baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until golden and bubbling, 55 to 65 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool 10 minutes before serving. Crisp is best served warm.</li>
        </ol>
